# React Experiments
A generic repository with a tiny code base for playing with react.

##Quick Start
1. Clone the repository

  `$ git clone https://github.com/cebroker/react-experiments/`

2. Create a new branch

  ```
  $ cd react-experiments
  $ git checkout -b my-new-experiment
  ```
  
3. Push it to the server

## Planned Experiments
1. Redux basic: implement a simple page that use Redux. No styling required.
2. Modular CSS: follow a style guiding either SMACSS or BEM. Evaluate how to use bootstraps from a CDN and do customization with theming.
3. Isomorphic: implement an maintenaible isomorphinc strategy.
4. Try react-starter-kit boilerplate
5. Try react-server framework


##Important!
Keep the master branch unmodified. Never merge a branch into it.




Have fun!
